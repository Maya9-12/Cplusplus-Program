# Cplusplus-Program

This project uses C++ and Python to produce a menu and completes mathematical tasks. Option 1 of the menu produces a multiplication table, option 2 doubles a user entered value and option 3 terminates the program. I think my choice of using a switch statement for the menu, followed the best practicies to create a more sophisticated code. On the other hand, to imporve my code I think I could have used more in line comments to help prove that I have a good understanding of what I am doing and to help people those who may need detailed explanations of my steps. 

I do not think the code was challenging to write at all the most challenging part may have been integretaing the two languages and remembering to update the starter code provided by my professor. The main takeaway skill from this project is my comfortability with switch statements. In any project in the future I may have where I need to crete a menu with options, I will be using switch statements for its convience and efficiency. To make my code more maintainable and readable I tried to use industry best practices like using sensible names for classes and being clear and trying not to be redundant.
